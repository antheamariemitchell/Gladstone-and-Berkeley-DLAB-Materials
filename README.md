R Fundamentals: Parts 1-4
---------------------------------
This workshop is a four-part introductory series that will teach you R from scratch with clear introductions, concise examples, and support documents. You will learn how to download and install the open-sourced R Studio software, understand data and basic manipulations, import and subset data, explore and visualize data, and understand the basics of automation in the form of loops and functions. After completion of this workshop you will have a foundational understanding to create, organize, and utilize workflows for your personal research.

Each of the parts is divided into a lecture-style coding walkthrough interrupted by challenge problems, discussions of the solutions, and breaks. Instructors and TAs are dedicated to engaging you in the classroom and answering questions in plain language. 

Prerequisites: None

Part 1: Introduction
Learn how to navigate the R Studio environment. You will also learn how to store data, characteristics of basic data types and data, the importance of data frames (think Excel spreadsheets), and how to save your work.

Part 2: Subsetting and Reshaping
You will then be introduced to loading data from files and various ways to subset it with an emphasis on bracket notation. You will also learn how to use logical vectors, search for and subset missing data, and merge data frames. 

Part 3: Data Exploration and Analysis
Students will be introduced to data exploration and analysis in R. You will learn how to summarize data and explore it with histograms, scatterplots, and boxplots. You will also be introduced to coding statistical data analysis via t-tests, analyses of variance, correlation, and linear regression.

Part 4: Data Importing and Visualization
In the final part, we will review data importing, more subsetting, and visualization. Students will then be given the majority of time to reproduce a workflow on two different datasets, ask questions, and dive in-depth to ggplot2.

Gladstone Institute’s Introduction to Statistics and Experimental Design Workshop
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:

Why do we perform experiments? What conclusions would we like to be able to draw from these experiments? Who are we trying to convince? How does the “magic” of statistics help us reach conclusions? This talk, by Reuben Thomas and Michela Traglia of the Bioinformatics Core, is open to anyone interested in learning more about experimental design, biological and technical aspect to consider, confounding factors and power analysis.

Gladstone Institute’s Introductory Machine Learning for Biologists 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Machine learning is becoming increasingly important not only in data science, but also in bioinformatics. Machine learning gives you the opportunity to find hidden patterns in your data and draw predictive conclusions. In this workshop, you’ll learn key machine learning concepts and categories, and get hands-on practice with simple examples. See how machine learning can be applied to advance your research!
 
The workshop will cover:

Supervised and unsupervised learning
Bias and variance
Cross validation
Nearest neighbors 
K-means clustering 
Decision trees
Support vector machines
Intermediate Level: Prior experience with R is required. See introductory workshop.

Berkeley D-Lab’s Python Fundamentals Workshop 
----------------------------------------------

Day_1 - Running Python, Jupyter Notebooks, variables assignment, data type conversion, working with strings, built-in functions

Day_2 - Lists, for-loops, conditional statements, writing your own functions, scope

Day_3 - Dictionaries, reading and writing data from and to files, installing and importing libraries, debugging errors, list comprehensions, beautiful code

Day_4 - Python application for information retrieval. You will extract targeted information from a text data set of United Nations documents to generate tabular data in a .csv file suitable for subsequent statistical analysis. Everything needed for this exercise is covered in Days 1, 2, and 3.
